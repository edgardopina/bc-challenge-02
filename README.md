# Bootcamp Challenge 02 - Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

The purpose of this portfolio page is to create a repository where I can add content to as the bootcamp course progresses.

This portfolio of work will showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. My portfolio will highlight my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. My goal is to have a portfolio(s) with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) to increase my chances to succeed in their career search after the boot camp. Having several deployed projects will ensure that I meet the minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

The core skills used in this project are: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

## User Story

- AS AN employer
- I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
- SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
